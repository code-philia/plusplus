REQUIREMENT_CONTRACT_INSTRUCTIONS = """Analyze one atomic requirement as a black box and fill the supplied fixed
template. Keep every required key and use [] when a section is empty. Describe only the requirement spec, external
inputs, observable outputs, required effects, and behavioral obligations. Set server_state to true only when satisfying
the requirement requires server-side state or server responsibilities (database access, runtime session/cookie state,
external interaction, authorization, persistence, transaction, idempotency, or another server-owned state transition).
Presentation, navigation, and client-local state are server_state=false and must have no server effects or server-owned
obligations. Every supplied scenario id must be covered
by at least one obligation. Obligations capture validation, authorization, computation, state transition, persistence,
transaction, idempotency, external interaction, or error mapping responsibilities; keep them implementation-neutral.
Whenever the contract contains a READ, CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE effect, include at least one PERSISTENCE obligation
covering that database responsibility.
Represent database reads as READ effects and state changes as their
corresponding effect operation. Use only supplied database entities and fields. Constraints in the context must be
reflected in the spec when they affect behavior; do not return constraint ids or allocate constraints to modules.
Every database access required to satisfy observable behavior must appear as a READ, CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE effect.
This includes persisted session records: when `session` is a supplied database entity, inserting a session row is
CREATE on `session`, not SESSION_WRITE. Reserve SESSION_WRITE for a non-database runtime session store. If the
requirement writes a browser cookie, include COOKIE_WRITE. In particular, checking whether values already exist for
UNIQUE or COMPOSITE_UNIQUE constraints requires a READ effect even when the database also enforces the constraint. Do
not hide required effects inside the prose spec.
Database access is implemented through one compiler-owned client injected into DB modules. Treat schema table symbols
as Drizzle table definitions, never as repositories or in-memory data containers; do not model table rows through
properties such as rows, data, or items.
Do not design modules, calls, steps, bindings, outcomes, guards, or algorithms. Keep every id concise (64 characters
or fewer). Return only the structured object.

Example shape:
{"requirement_id":"REQ-1.1","spec":"Register one traveler.","server_state":true,"inputs":[{"semantic_id":"registration.username","name":"username","type":"string","description":"Requested username.","required":true}],"outputs":[{"semantic_id":"traveler.id","name":"traveler_id","type":"uuid","description":"Created traveler id.","required":true}],"effects":[{"id":"create_traveler","operation":"CREATE","target":"traveler","fields":["username"]}],"obligations":[{"id":"validate_registration","kind":"VALIDATION","description":"Reject invalid registration data.","scenario_ids":["REQ-1.1:scenario:1"]}]}
"""

API_DECOMPOSITION_INSTRUCTIONS = """Turn one Requirement Contract into API modules. Keep one user action in one API
unless the requirement explicitly defines multiple operations. Every API contains exactly kind, name, spec, inputs,
outputs, effects, and obligation_ids. Set kind to API. Copy interface fields and effects from the supplied contract without changing
their semantic identifiers, types, or required flags. Field names are local parameter labels and may be made clearer
without changing the represented data. A module whose spec describes a database read or write must own the
corresponding effect from the supplied contract; never describe hidden database access on a module with an empty
effects list. Allocate every supplied obligation id to exactly one API. Treat negative or preventive obligations
(for example prevent_duplicate_write, prevent_book_persistence, or no_session_on_failure) as real obligations;
they must not be omitted because they describe something that must not happen. Before returning, compare the
complete parent obligation id set with the union of API obligation_ids exactly.
Do not design child functions or implementation steps. Return only `{\"modules\": [...]}`.
"""

MODULE_DECOMPOSITION_INSTRUCTIONS = """Read the layered Markdown context and decompose the current module from the top down.
Silently plan how the parent responsibility is completed, then return only its direct child modules in execution order.

Every child contains exactly seven top-level fields: kind, name, spec, inputs, outputs, effects, and obligation_ids. Each interface field
contains semantic_id, name, type, and required. Preserve required exactly when reusing a parent field; mark newly
introduced values required only when the child cannot complete without them. An API may call FUNC only. A
FUNC may contain its own logic and may call FUNC or DB modules. The compiler-provided schema is authoritative: below an
API, at most two FUNC levels may be materialized; when the current FUNC is already at level two, only DB children (or no
children) are legal. A DB module is always a leaf. The list order is the call
order. A module input must come from the parent inputs or an earlier child output. Copy the exact interface field and
effect identifiers supplied in the Markdown. Keep child responsibilities cohesive and smaller than the parent. Return
an empty modules list when a FUNC can complete its remaining pure logic itself. Database effects are exactly READ,
CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE; they must be delegated to DB modules and may not remain inside a terminal FUNC.
SESSION_WRITE, COOKIE_WRITE, and EXTERNAL_IO are application effects and must never be assigned to a DB module. Every
DB child must own at least one database effect. Never invent an effect: when the parent effect table is empty, all
child effects must be [] and no DB child may be introduced. A child whose spec describes database access must own one
of the exact effects listed in the parent table.
Copy obligation ids exactly. An API must delegate every obligation to one direct FUNC child. A FUNC may implement
non-persistence obligations itself, but every PERSISTENCE obligation must eventually be delegated to a DB leaf.
DB children may own only PERSISTENCE obligations. Never invent, rename, omit, or duplicate an obligation id.
Before returning, perform an obligation ledger check: the union of direct-child obligation_ids must equal the
parent's required obligation ids exactly. Negative obligations such as prevent/no-write/no-create are still real
behavioral obligations and must be allocated. For every PERSISTENCE obligation, ensure at least one child path can
continue to a DB leaf that owns the corresponding persistence responsibility.

The compiler supplies every DB leaf with one shared Drizzle `database` client and its relevant schema table imports.
The table symbols describe SQL tables; they are not data-bearing objects and must never be described as exposing
rows, data, items, or other in-memory collections. A DB leaf performs its declared effect through that client.

Treat semantic_id as the stable identity of a data value and type as its canonical data type. The name is only a local
parameter label and may differ between modules. A child output may introduce new data or pass through/refine data that
is already available, such as returning account.id after verifying its password. When reusing a semantic_id, preserve
its type exactly. Within one module interface, different semantic_id values must use different name values; for example,
call a stored account password `stored_password` when the supplied login password is already named `password`. Do not
invent a new semantic_id merely to represent that an existing value passed validation.

Do not output any fields beyond the seven listed above. The compiler derives symbol IDs and graph relationships. Return
only the structured `{\"modules\": [...]}` object.
