# Agentic Requirement Compiler (ARC)

<p align="center">
  ARC treats requirements as compilable artifacts rather than loose prompt context.
  It turns structured requirement trees into interfaces, tests, code, and an auditable execution trail.

> ARC uses a deterministic compiler controller. Models may later execute schema-constrained semantic passes, but they do not control parsing, linking, scheduling, freezing, or repository permissions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The codebase is being migrated from the original staged-agent implementation to the compiler architecture in [docs/guide.md](docs/guide.md). The deterministic requirement front end is implemented; discovery, design, lowering, implementation, and acceptance passes are still pending. Until those passes land, `arc compile` intentionally exits non-zero after writing front-end artifacts rather than claiming that a runnable application was produced.

## Replication Benchmark (ARC-Bench)

The performance of ARC can be validated on [ARC-Bench](https://github.com/code-philia/arc-bench), which consists of a number of applications, their requirements, corresponding validation tests, and reference behavior (via web domain address).


## Why ARC

Most AI coding workflows are still prompt-centric. A model reads a large requirement document, tries to infer structure implicitly, and produces code in one or a few broad passes.

ARC takes a compiler-oriented view instead:

- Requirements are not just context. They are the source program.
- Tests are not just verification. They are executable constraints.
- Traceability is not optional metadata. It is part of the system contract.

In practice, ARC parses requirements into versioned intermediate representations, resolves dependencies into a graph, and records every accepted transformation as traceable artifacts.

## What ARC Does

ARC is designed as a requirement-to-system compiler with a staged pipeline:

| Stage | What ARC does |
| --- | --- |
| **Structured requirement modeling** | Consumes a hierarchical requirement tree with dependencies, scenarios, and optional multimodal references such as screenshots or design assets. |
| **Deterministic front end** | Normalizes FOLDER/ATOMIC nodes, assigns stable scenario IDs, preserves provenance, validates dependencies, and emits topological ATOMIC implementation waves. |
| **Global design (planned)** | Builds Fact IR and a Global Symbol Table before lowering frozen Design IR into a whole-program skeleton. |
| **Constrained implementation (planned)** | Generates requirement and contract tests, then grants workers write capability only for declared implementation regions. |
| **Traceability by default** | Records the requirement-to-interface-to-test-to-code chain instead of treating generation as a black box. |

## Getting Started

Use the following setup as a practical baseline. The installation example below uses `uv`.

### Requirements

- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A virtual environment and package manager such as [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- An OpenAI-compatible API endpoint and model is optional until semantic passes are enabled

Additional requirements for web generation:
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) with [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Additional requirements for Android generation:
- [JDK 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)
- [Android SDK / Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with `platforms;android-34` and `build-tools;34.0.0`

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository and its template submodule
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/code-philia/agentic-requirement-compiler.git
cd agentic-requirement-compiler

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # On Windows PowerShell

# Install ARC
uv pip install -e .
```

After installation, the `arc` command will be available in your virtual environment.

**Verify installation:**
```bash
arc --version
arc --help
```

### Configuration

**Quick setup (recommended):**

```bash
arc config
```

This will interactively prompt you for required configuration values and create/update `.env`.

**Manual setup:**

Copy `.env_example` to `.env` and fill in your API credentials:

```bash
cp .env_example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```bash
# Optional: semantic model passes
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
MODEL=gpt-5.6
ARC_OPENAI_API_MODE=responses

# Optional: Debug mode
ARC_DEBUG=0
```

**Validate configuration:**
```bash
arc doctor
```

### Input: Requirement Model

ARC consumes a hierarchical requirement tree with `FOLDER` and `ATOMIC` nodes, dependency links, and executable scenarios. See [example/](example/) for complete examples.

At minimum, ARC expects:

- `requirements.yaml`
- optional assets such as `reference/...`

Conceptually, ARC produces three layers of output:

- **Compiler artifacts**: Requirement IR, dependency graph, diagnostics, and later Fact/Design/Module IR
- **Runnable system**: the generated target project after all compiler passes are implemented
- **Execution memory**: queue state, debug logs, and intermediate compiler artifacts
- **Audit trail**: traceability records and git history that explain how requirements became code

This is one of the main differences between ARC and prompt-only code generation: the result is not just an output directory, but a recoverable compilation process.

### CLI Usage

ARC expects a requirement directory containing `requirements.yaml`.

Minimal input layout:

```text
my-requirement-dir
|-- requirements.yaml
`-- reference/
    `-- homepage.png
```

**Basic usage:**

```bash
arc compile /path/to/my-requirement-dir -o workspace/output
```

**With options:**

```bash
arc compile example/ticketbooking-demo -o workspace/demo \
  --type web \
  --port 3301 \
  --clean
```

#### Available Commands

- **`arc compile`** - Compile requirements into a working application
- **`arc config`** - Configure ARC interactively (create/update .env)
- **`arc doctor`** - Check configuration and environment health

Run `arc --help` or `arc compile --help` for detailed usage.

#### Main Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `requirement_path` | Requirement directory containing `requirements.yaml` |
| `-o, --output-dir` | Output workspace directory (required) |
| `-t, --type` | Application type: `web`, `android`, or `cli` (default: `web`) |
| `--port` | Backend port for web applications (default: 3301) |
| `--clean` | Remove existing output directory before compilation |
| `--resume` | Resume from saved compilation queue |
| `--retry-failed` | Retry all failed nodes (requires `--resume`) |
| `--retry NODE_ID...` | Retry specific node IDs (requires `--resume`) |

#### Runtime behavior

- Compilation artifacts are written beneath `<output-dir>/.arc/`.
- `.arc/compiler/requirement_ir.json` contains the normalized source representation and provenance.
- `.arc/compiler/dependency_graph.json` contains explicit and effective ATOMIC dependencies plus implementation waves.
- `.arc/compiler/diagnostics.json` contains stable diagnostic codes.
- `.arc/processing_queue.json` is a versioned pass queue; it no longer represents per-node agent sessions.
- Existing CLI resume/retry parameters remain accepted while pass-level resume semantics are implemented.

#### Model API mode

ARC supports two OpenAI-compatible API modes, configured via `ARC_OPENAI_API_MODE` in `.env`:

- `chat_completions` (default) - Uses `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, most compatible
- `responses` - Uses `/v1/responses` endpoint for models that support it

Set this in your `.env` file (see Configuration section above).


## Visualization

If you want a visual execution workflow with progress tracking and result visualization, use **ARC-Bench**: [arc-bench.com](http://arc-bench.com).

### Use Built-in ARC Agent (Recommended)

When submitting a task on ARC-Bench, select **"ARC"** from the built-in agents dropdown. This uses the official ARC implementation maintained by the ARC-Bench team.


### Custom ARC Bundle (For Modified Versions)

If you've modified ARC, package and upload your custom version:

1. Copy the contents of `src/` into your submission bundle root
2. Keep `main.py` at the bundle root
3. Zip the bundle
4. Upload to ARC-Bench as a custom agent

A minimal bundle layout:

```text
submission/
|-- main.py
|-- requirements.txt
|-- agents/
|-- context/
|-- core/
`-- ...
```

ARC-Bench provides the container runtime, workspace lifecycle, event streaming, and visualization layer. ARC performs the actual requirement-to-project compilation inside that environment.

## Positioning

ARC is not trying to be a generic chat wrapper around an LLM.  
It is an attempt to make AI software generation more **structured**, **test-constrained**, and **inspectable**.

If you care about:

- turning requirement documents into working systems,
- making agent execution auditable,
- connecting tests directly to requirement intent,
- and keeping generated code understandable after the run,

then ARC is the right abstraction to explore.

## Research Context

ARC is also a research-driven system. It reflects a broader idea:

> software generation becomes more reliable when requirements are structured, tests are generated before implementation, and every transformation step remains inspectable.

That is the technical direction behind ARC's requirement graph modeling, test-first workflow, and traceability design. See  https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13723
